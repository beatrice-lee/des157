                            <p>At first glance, this photo messaging application does not offer much explanation as to why the user should use it. Snapchat is a fun space allowing anyone that has access to a smartphone with an automatic camera feature. The
                                users can simply take a photograph of anything they desire while viewing and sharing the images with a wide range of audiences. This includes friends, family, artist, celebrities, and many more. Like most applications that
                                offer a tutorial immediately when users open an app for the first time, Snapchat starts off with a main screen as the camera screen to first-time users. There are no rules and no hints thus, allowing users to freely play
                                around figuring out how the application works. Once after taking a photographic image on the screen, the user can take this approach that presents a far more greater interest thus, intriguing most users like myself that
                                contains the option to alter an image through one of the main editing features called filters. With consistant daily updates on the filter feature, this also allows users to actively interact with the application creating
                                an addictiveness to continue using the Snapchat application. Although this may include countless of features including a hot streak, live video, live chat, memory storage, news entertainment, customization bitmoji, emoji
                                platform, drawing tool, and their recent new feature with group chats, this does not hinder the user experience in snapchat which itsâ€™ main purpose is for fun without having to think too much about it. Not only does snapchat
                                have a minimalistic and simple design, the white and yellow colors create a friendly and playful style which is appropriately used for this app, and their iconic ghost logo design which is said to represent the disappearance
                                of an image after it has been seen by the user. Once exploring the applications over a period of time, fun over function is the new concept that the users will experience through this application. </p>
